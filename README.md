sd-rtc-logger
=============

This was a quick project to build a data logger, useful around the lab or elsewhere.
It can be built in a couple of hours, and with dozens of uses.
The facility to log events or values over time is extremely important for many
projects - it is a useful Swiss army knife to have around when needed.
This project uses a Tiva LaunchPad which is a small board from Texas Instruments
containing an ARM chip.
